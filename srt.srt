Hoon Sam Three . Approach round and round .

Lee Eun-cheol’s radar, who has just become a high school student, is back .

New school, new classroom, new classmates .

Lee Eun-chul’s eyes are stingy as he looks at the atmosphere of the class sitting behind the classroom . Who will be putting himself down, who will be his friend .

A single glance quickly makes a decision .

This is a world of junk food .

Most of the children in the group seemed prey to Lee Eun-chul .

Most of the kids who were in the snow avoided their eyes .

‘……There is nothing . ”

But .

Rather, he was smiling and approaching .

‘Cho Sho Ho . ’

It is a friend who flew away from the neighborhood .

I sometimes met when I was drinking with my friends .

“Are you here too?”

“uh . ”

A short quarrel came and went, but it was only a while .

Cho, who had been familiar with Lee ‘s notoriety, leaned in first .

“Let’s stay well . ”

Lee Eun-chul smiled and grabbed his hand .

There is a precedence of sequence, but this guy is ‘friend’ . So while sorting out the semblance relationship .

Strangely, there was a guy who caught Lee Eun Chul’s eye .

It is not the schoolboy sitting at the front, nor is it the person who takes a seat at the back and brags .

Classroom A strange guy who sits in the middle of nowhere but does not avoid his gaze . There is .

About one in half .

They do not know their fountains, so what should happen is they are dull to see the top and bottom .

Looking back, he sighed as if he was pathetic and looked ahead, Lee Eun-chul stood up and could not bear it .

I will .

The noise of the chair was loudly ringing in the classroom .

Of course, all the eyes in the classroom turned to Lee Euncheol .

Lee Eun-cheol enjoyed those gaze and approached the guy who did not know the fountain with a feeling of fuss .

“Hey . ”

I want to grab his shoulder and turn him over .

A tackle came where I could not think of .

“Wait a minute . ”

Lee Eun-cheol opened his mouth to report on his own wrist grip .

“What?”

The nervous planting of the vigorously dissolved voices of the nervous Gongho sucked a dry spit .

“It was the same school . Do not touch him . ”

“……The same school? ”

Is it just like this school because of the school?

If so, either .

There are hard reasons to say, there is no reason not to touch .

Or is this Lee Euncheol making fun of it .

Lee Eun-chul, whose face was hardened, tugged at the chair of ‘the guy’ who did not look back even in this upheaval .

“Hey, hey, what are you? You’re talking . Do not you have a mouth? ”

Then Shogun, who was speculative, stepped forward and wanted to go away .

Lee Eun-cheol, who is different from the limit of patience, struck his hand with his hand and opened his eyes .

“You follow me . ”

Behind Lee Eun-cheol, who is going out of the classroom, two Iljin who came out of the same junior high school were caught up .

On the threshold of the classroom, Lee Eun-cheol looked back and saw Gongho, who is sweating in the cold weather, and ‘the guy,’ who does not even show interest yet .

Blooming .

In Lee Eun-cheol’s eyes, Hye-yeon was living .

* * * “Great!”

His face was ruined by a mess, and he stumbled .

Still, Lee Eun-chul’s eyes were still bloody, even though he was still unresolved .

Lee Eun-cheol, who pushed Shon-Ho to the wall, asked .

“What is the cub? What is it that you are cheap? ”

Cho, who was throwing a rough breath toward the floor, spat a spit with blood .

His face with his head was tired .

“We’re the best in junior high school . ”

“……?”Lee’s head tilted .

This guy .

Is that a bit out of his mind?

It was a publicly known fact that the group was holding their schools tightly .

However, Cho emphasized his head .

“We can not touch our hands . I thought I’d be out of here too .

At first, I made a bullshit, and I was serious about being such a thing .

‘This cub … Seriously? ”

no .

If there is such a person, there is no rumor .

Seongsoo Ho .

Lee Euncheol’s ear, which has lived in this neighborhood all the time since elementary school, has never heard such a name .

What can a child like that guy do to me in the first place?

Lee Eun-cheol was angry to the end of his head because he was afraid of him .

Crap!

Lee Eun-cheol swung in the full swing and his head went back to his side .

Soon the right cheek was swollen red .

I learned boxing since I was a kid .

However, there was another thing which was really afraid of .

At that time, Jeongho, who stood up to the ruthless violence of Lee Euncheol, discovered something .

‘……!’Lee Seon-cheol’s head went back to report that his eyes were getting bigger .

From a distance .

The man was approaching this way .

Cho said that he did not want to face his opponent .

“just…… Apologize . It is a sincere advice . ”

“This kid is real!”

Lee Eun-cheol grabbed the back of his back, but Shogun had just shut his mouth .

Just before the ridiculous word comes out from Lee ‘s mouth .

Suh, the beginning of all this, stood before them .

Is it because of the story I just heard from Cho?

If it is usual, Lee Eun-chul, who once flew from his fist, withdrew from Cho-ho and watched the guard .

Although it is not small, it does not seem big compared to the person who is out of the high 1st level or the person who is in charge of the . The usual big .

Though the neck or wrist that appears between uniforms seems a little exhausted, it is not a body that specializes in exercise .

Lee Euncheol could not believe his words .

Sure, Suho stood in front of Cho Sung-ho and looked into his face injured by a mess .

ø¤ø¤ .

I was saddened to hear the sound of tongue clapping .

“Sung ho . ”

“… . . uh . ”

“Let’s do it again this time . That’s just self-defense . ”

Shogun, without hesitation, nodded his head .

“Yes . ”

What do you think you did?

Lee Eun-chul, who was listening with a strange face, waved his face .

“Hey . ”

The moment he put his guard down on his shoulder to turn the guard, the light flashed in front of his eyes .

thud!

Lee, who lost consciousness, fell on the floor .

Nearly at the same time, two of them, standing behind Lee Eun Cheol, lost consciousness .

Boom, Boom!

‘Scary bastard ……’

Choo had tongue overtaken .

Movement that would not have seen properly if it was not the sight of the fuselage pulled into motion .

It was a single room on the face of Lee Eun Cheol, a room on the back of each of his backyard boys, and a precise and brutal blow like a machine .

At first, when I was mistaken for the mistake, I was thinking that it was really human power .

After that, unlike the expectation, school life got easier .

Looking at the fallen Lee Eun-cheol, Seongho was scratching his back .

‘……’Lee Euncheol ‘s nose, broken knees with broken bone .

The rumor will soon pass .

It is said that Lee Eun-cheol of XX in the world fell to Cho .

It is better than rumors that I am hit by a normal student without a name, and Lee Eun – chul will shut up .

‘then……’

So again, the victory was added to his monarchy .

It is a feeling of disappointment that somebody gives victory .

While I was thinking about this kind of thing, the guard came up to me .

“This is how it happened … I would also like to ask you here . ”

Shojo, who scratches his cheek, grabbed his hand without speaking .
