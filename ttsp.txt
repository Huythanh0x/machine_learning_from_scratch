Is there a videogame you enjoy that uses simple graphics, relies more on action or puzzles than high fidelity art/audio atmosphere, and can get by with straightforward level structures and (if applicable) AI?

Clone it. Or at least most of its core functionality. Not as a business move, and not to try to get famous off it, just as an exercise in studying the details of its gameplay.

By cloning a game that you already like, you will…

1. …be pulled into studying the concrete ins and outs of an existing game in great detail.

2. …have a clear, complete, and coherent target to compare your work against.

3. …avoid being stalled by uncertainty about what else is left to be done.

4. …skip the common beginner risk of stalling until quitting from lack of knowing when/how to end the design phase.

5. …focus first on how to make things work, without being distracted by deciding what to make work.
